##Track Your Ones##
###Description###
Track Your Ones is a minimalist Android social app with the sole purpose of keeping track of your dear ones. You can track their location, see their statuses and even contact them by sending messages. This app is similar to WhatsApp. 
###Technical Description###
REST architecture backend. MySQL to store data from users, and Php acts as the MVC converting controlling outputs in JSON. Php runs specific query's when addressed by App and takes params given from the app. App sends both GET/POST requests to which Php handles them. 
###Still In Alpha Mode###
This app is still in Alpha stage because I need to do a couple of minor bug fixes, and some minor UI changes as well (for example, the colour of the listView object the contains the people info)
